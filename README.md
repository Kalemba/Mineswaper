# Mineswaper
Current application is prototype of minesweeper game.

Current features:
-Setting mine field based on input size and mines number. Counting mines in surrounding fields.
-Right mouse button flag setting represented by "F".
-Right mouse button Highlighting of surrounding fields. (Right button actions need upgrade)


Features I'm planing to code:
-Script ending the game after hiting the mine and restarting the game.
-Scrit for revealing surrouding unmarket by flag fields when number of flags are equal number of mines around.
-First field is always minefree.
-Numbers represented by different colors.
-Timer and highscores feature.
